# Bank-management-system

Description of the project:
The provided code is a simple console-based Bank Management System implemented in C#. It allows users to perform various banking operations such as adding customers, opening accounts, closing accounts, depositing funds, withdrawing funds, and displaying customer information and account transaction history.

At its core, the system consists of three main classes: Customer, Account, and Transaction, representing customers, their accounts, and transaction details respectively. The Bank class encapsulates the business logic and operations of the bank, managing customers and their accounts.

Customers can be added with their basic details like name, address, and phone number. Accounts can be opened for existing customers, with a choice between savings and checking account types. Accounts can also be closed by specifying the account number. Deposits and withdrawals are supported, with transaction history being recorded for each account.

Overall, this Bank Management System provides a basic framework for managing customer accounts and transactions within a bank, suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for building more complex banking software.
